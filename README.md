# Jerm-s-ZMI-Runecrafter
Source code for my zmi crafter.

- Script is still in development. 

- Need to train up another account to Lunar diplomacy status so I can continue development. Was banned due to leaving the account overnight spam clicking the minimap by accident. Didn't mean to start a script, but somehow I did. Was not using this script, was using one of my data collection scripts.

- My personal API was left out so that the code is harder to copy while still in development.

- Code is here for the purpose of feedback.

- To do:
  - Create a GUI.
  - Create a better paint interface.
  - Optimize walking paths.
  - Add several antiban methods.
  - Add option to follow players.
  - More that I have written down, but thats most of it.
